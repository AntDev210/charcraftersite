        <p>The Ball of Wool is an essential intermediate crafting material in CharCrafter, primarily derived from raw Wool. It serves as a core component for advanced textile crafting, weaponry, and outpost construction projects. As a non-consumable utility item, its main value lies entirely in its role as a crafting prerequisite, and it occupies a single slot in the Standard Inventory, which has a maximum capacity of 80 slots.</p>
        
        <h3 class="pixel-text" style="color: #00ff00; margin-top: 20px;">ACQUISITION AND TRANSFORMATION</h3>
        <p>The Ball of Wool is not found directly in the world but is created by the player using the Personal Crafting interface. The raw material required is Wool, which is typically acquired as animal loot.</p>
        
        <h5 class="pixel-text" style="color: #00ff00; margin-top: 20px;">RECIPE & CRAFTING TIME</h5>
        <p>The conversion process is as follows:</p>
        <ul class="wiki-list">
            <li>To produce one Ball of Wool, the player must use 4x raw Wool.</li>
            <li>The crafting of this item falls under the 'Utility' category.</li>
            <li>The process is time-intensive, requiring a working period of 30,000 to 40,000 seconds, which translates to approximately 8.3 to 11.1 hours of in-game time.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3 class="pixel-text" style="color: #00ff00; margin-top: 20px;">USAGE IN CRAFTING</h3>
        <p>The Ball of Wool is a crucial component used directly in 15 distinct recipes, demonstrating its importance across survival, combat, and infrastructure crafting trees.</p>
        
        <h5 class="pixel-text" style="color: #00ff00; margin-top: 20px;">WEAPONS, TOOLS & ARMOR</h5>
        <p>The Ball of Wool is necessary for creating several vital tools and combat items. Notably, it is a key ingredient in almost all ranged weapons:</p>
        <ul class="wiki-list">
            <li>For basic ranged combat, the Bow requires 1x Ball of Wool and 2x Wood.</li>
            <li>The Crossbow, despite being a separate craft, also requires 1x Ball of Wool, along with 4x Wood and 1x Iron.</li>
            <li>For utility and food gathering, the Fishing Rod requires 1x Ball of Wool and 2x Wood.</li>
            <li>To create light sources, 1x Ball of Wool, 1x Wood, and either 1x Coal or 1x Charcoal are combined to produce 8x Torches.</li>
            <li>Defensive measures include the Wooden Shield, which costs 2x Ball of Wool and 16x Wood.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h5 class="pixel-text" style="color: #00ff00; margin-top: 20px;">INTERMEDIATE MATERIALS (ROPE & LEASH)</h5>
        <p>As an intermediate material, the Ball of Wool is converted into Rope, which is subsequently used for animal management:</p>
        <ul class="wiki-list">
            <li>Rope is crafted using 4x Ball of Wool. This craft is quick, requiring only 120 to 240 seconds.</li>
            <li>The Leash, a tool required to capture animals, is created from 1x Rope, making the Leash's true cost 4x Ball of Wool.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5 class="pixel-text" style="color: #00ff00; margin-top: 20px;">TEXTILES & SHELTER PROJECTS</h5>
        <p>The textile crafting process relies heavily on the Ball of Wool, as it is the component that activates the primary tool:</p>
        <ul class="wiki-list">
            <li>Busy Knitting Needles (in Wooden, Copper, and Iron tiers) are created by combining 4x Ball of Wool with the corresponding non-busy Knitting Needles. These 'Busy' tools are the prerequisite for crafting all types of clothing and the Blanket.</li>
            <li>The Blanket, which takes 30,000 to 40,000 seconds to craft, requires the use of the Busy Knitting Needles.</li>
            <li>The Sleeping Bag requires 2x Blanket, making the Ball of Wool an indirect cost in its creation.</li>
            <li>For permanent housing, the Bed Kit requires 1x Ball of Wool, 3x Blanket, 1x Sleeping Bag, and 10x Wood. This specific project takes 30,000 to 40,000 seconds.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h5 class="pixel-text" style="color: #00ff00; margin-top: 20px;">OUTPOST AND TERRITORY CLAIMING</h5>
        <p>The Ball of Wool is also used in projects available at the Outpost workbench:</p>
        <ul class="wiki-list">
            <li>The Outpost Banner, used for claiming territory, is a very expensive project requiring 2x Ball of Wool, 1x Blanket, 2x Iron, and 10x Wood. The time cost for this strategic item is the longest, ranging from 100,000 to 200,000 seconds.</li>
        </ul>
