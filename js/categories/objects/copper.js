        <p>Copper is the Grade 1 metallic mineral that represents the first major step in a survivor's technological progression. It allows for the creation of tools that are significantly more efficient than basic stone implements, reducing physical fatigue.</p>
        
        <p>While iron remains the goal for mid-game, copper is essential for early survival. It offers a balanced compromise between resource availability and performance, making it the primary material for those beginning to explore the cave systems.</p>
        
        <h3 class="pixel-text" style="color: #00ff00; margin-top: 20px;">LOCATION AND IDENTIFICATION</h3>
        <p>Identifying copper is the first skill every miner must master to move beyond the stone age:</p>
        
        <ul class="wiki-list">
            <li><strong>Distinctive Sign:</strong> Deposits are easily recognized by their characteristic <strong>Orange/Bronze</strong> color. The map symbol starts as a solid block (█).</li>
            <li><strong>Extraction States:</strong> As the vein is depleted, the symbol changes through several stages (▓, ▒, ∷) until the resource is completely exhausted.</li>
            <li><strong>Geological Distribution:</strong> Copper is most abundant in Cave Level 1, where it serves as the primary mineral. It becomes significantly rarer as you descend into Level 2.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3 class="pixel-text" style="color: #00ff00; margin-top: 20px;">EXTRACTION AND ENERGY COSTS</h3>
        <p>Transitioning from a stone pickaxe to a copper one is a turning point for energy management. Copper tools allow the player to perform more actions before needing to rest or eat.</p>
        
        <ul class="wiki-list">
            <li><strong>Energy Cost (Copper Pickaxe):</strong> 10 Energy per use (compared to 15 for stone).</li>
            <li><strong>Processing Time:</strong> Extraction with a copper pickaxe takes between 43200 and 57600 seconds (approximately 12-16 in-game hours).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3 class="pixel-text" style="color: #00ff00; margin-top: 20px;">THE ART OF CRAFTING</h3>
        <p>Similar to iron, copper equipment requires a collaboration between the <strong>Metalworker</strong> and the <strong>Woodworker</strong>.</p>
        
        <h5 class="pixel-text" style="color: #00ff00; margin-top: 10px;">METALWORKER (FORGING)</h5>
        <p>The Metalworker transforms raw copper into specialized components or finished blades:</p>
        <ul class="wiki-list">
            <li><strong>Copper Axe Head:</strong> 12x Copper (+ 12 coins)</li>
            <li><strong>Copper Pickaxe Head:</strong> 10x Copper (+ 12 coins)</li>
            <li><strong>Copper Shovel Head:</strong> 5x Copper (+ 12 coins)</li>
            <li><strong>Copper Sword:</strong> 10x Copper (+ 20 coins)</li>
            <li><strong>Copper Knife:</strong> 2x Copper (+ 10 coins)</li>
        </ul>

        <h5 class="pixel-text" style="color: #00ff00; margin-top: 10px;">WOODWORKER (ASSEMBLY)</h5>
        <p>The Woodworker handles the final assembly of the tools:</p>
        <ul class="wiki-list">
            <li><strong>Copper Axe:</strong> 1x Copper Axe Head + 1x Wood (+ 4 coins)</li>
            <li><strong>Copper Pickaxe:</strong> 1x Copper Pickaxe Head + 1x Wood (+ 4 coins)</li>
            <li><strong>Copper Shovel:</strong> 1x Copper Shovel Head + 1x Wood (+ 4 coins)</li>
        </ul>

        <h5 class="pixel-text" style="color: #00ff00; margin-top: 10px;">ARMOR (METALWORKER ONLY)</h5>
        <p>Copper provides the first layer of metallic defense against cave threats:</p>
        <ul class="wiki-list">
            <li><strong>Light Copper Armor:</strong> 14x Copper (+ 30 coins)</li>
            <li><strong>Normal Copper Armor:</strong> 26x Copper (+ 35 coins)</li>
            <li><strong>Heavy Copper Armor:</strong> 38x Copper (+ 40 coins)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3 class="pixel-text" style="color: #00ff00; margin-top: 20px;">ECONOMIC VALUE</h3>
        <ul class="wiki-list">
            <li><strong>Sale Value:</strong> Raw copper can be sold for <strong>5 coins</strong> per unit.</li>
            <li><strong>Processing:</strong> Refining "Raw Copper" into "Copper" at the Metalworker is a free service, requiring only the raw material.</li>
        </ul>
