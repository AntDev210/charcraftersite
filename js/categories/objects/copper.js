        <p>Raw Copper is the transitional metallic mineral in the game, marking the shift from primitive stone tools to the more efficient metal implements. This resource is crucial for progression, as Copper equipment offers a noticeable improvement in energy efficiency compared to Stone.</p>
        
        <h3 class="pixel-text" style="color: #00ff00; margin-top: 20px;">LOCATION AND IDENTIFICATION</h3>
        <p>Copper deposits are predominantly located in Level 1 Cave, serving as the primary mining target for early players, although they are also present in Level 2.</p>
        
        <ul class="wiki-list">
            <li>Map Symbol: Deposits are distinguished on the map by the solid block Tile (█) colored Red.</li>
            <li>States: The symbol progressively evolves into semi-empty states (▓, ▒, ∷) as the mineral vein becomes exhausted, but it always retains its distinctive Red coloring.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3 class="pixel-text" style="color: #00ff00; margin-top: 20px;">EXTRACTION AND ENERGY COSTS</h3>
        <p>Copper extraction represents the equilibrium point between the high cost of Stone and the efficiency of Iron. Using a Copper Pickaxe incurs an Energy cost of 10 Energy to the character.</p>
        
        <ul class="wiki-list">
            <li>Energy Cost (Copper Pickaxe): 10 Energy per use.</li>
            <li>Processing Time: Extraction requires a time interval between 43200 and 57600 seconds (approximately 12-16 in-game hours).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="pixel-text" style="color: #00ff00; margin-top: 20px;">METALWORKER CRAFTING AND USAGE</h3>
        <p>Processed Copper is the base ingredient for Level 2 crafting, primarily performed by the metalworker and almost always requiring a coin fee.</p>

        <h5 class="pixel-text" style="color: #00ff00; margin-top: 20px;">COMPONENTS AND TOOLS</h5>
        <ul class="wiki-list">
            <li>Tool Heads: Require from 5 units (shovel) to 12 units (axe) of Copper. The woodworker then combines the head with 1 unit of wood and a 4 coin fee.</li>
            <li>Knitting Needles:4 units are needed for Copper Knitting Needles.</li>
            <li>Armaments and Defense: Copper Swords (10 units), Knives (2 units), and Shields (14 units) are created.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5 class="pixel-text" style="color: #00ff00; margin-top: 20px;">COPPER ARMOR (UNIT COSTS)</h5>
        <ul class="wiki-list">
            <li>Light Armor: 14 units of Copper.</li>
            <li>Normal Armor: 26 units of Copper.</li>
            <li>Heavy Armor: 38 units of Copper.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h5 class="pixel-text" style="color: #00ff00; margin-top: 20px;">FOOD PROCESSING</h5>
        <p>The Copper Knife is crucial for food processing, particularly for filleting all types of fish. Using this knife reduces the crafting time to an interval between 10000 and 25000 seconds per operation.</p>
        
        <h3 class="pixel-text" style="color: #00ff00; margin-top: 20px;">ECONOMIC VALUE AND LOGISTICS</h3>
        <p>Economically, raw Copper is a tradable asset that offers a decent return on initial investment:</p>
        <ul class="wiki-list">
            <li>Sale Value: Raw Copper can be sold for 15 coins per unit to the metalworker.</li>
            <li>Logistics: Copper, like all resources, contributes to the player's maximum inventory capacity, which is fixed at 80 units. Its collection requires transport planning to prevent overloading.</li>
        </ul>
