        <p>CharCrafter is a 2D terminal SandBox/RPG game made by "AQUIL the eagle", released the first time on July 10, 2025.</p>
        <p>It was created the first time in the late 2023, a simple project discontinued like the rest. The first try was similar like the last one, but with more a RPG style than a SandBox one like now.</p>
        <p>It was recreated the second and last time (this published one) in the early days on July, 2025, as the last time trying to create a game that lasted more than the previous ones. It still gets updates to this game, as a good project.</p>
